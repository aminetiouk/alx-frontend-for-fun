This project demonstrates a form structure built with HTML and CSS, following best practices and including comments, input labels, error handling, and a search form.

## Project Outline

The project is divided into multiple sections, each focusing on a specific part of the form development. Below is a detailed breakdown of each step.

### 0. Basic Comment Structure

- **Purpose**: Further enhances readability and provides context for each part of the code.

### 2. Create Labels and Input Container
